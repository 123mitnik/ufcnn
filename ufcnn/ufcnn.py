    The architecture replicates one from the paper [1]_. It is depicted below
    for 3 levels::

        input -- H1 ---------------------------- G1 -- C -- output
                     |                        |
                     -- H2 -------------- G2 --
                           |            |
                           -- H3 -- G3 --

    Here H and G are convolutional layers, each followed by ReLU
    transformation. The outputs are concatenated at branch merges.
    All filter (except C) outputs `n_filters` signals, but because of
    concatenations filter G1 and G2 have to process 2 * `n_filters` signals.

    A filter on level l implicitly contains 2**(l-1) zeros inserted between
    its values. It allows the network to progressively look farther into the
    past and learn dependencies on wide range of time scales.

    The important thing in time-series modeling is applying filters in a
    causal-way, i.e. convolutions must not include values after a current
    time moment. This is achieved by zero-padding from the left before
    applying the convolution.

    Implementation is done in tensorflow.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_inputs : int, default 1
        Number of input time series.
    n_outputs : int, default 1
        Number of output time series.
    n_levels : int, default 1
        Number of levels in the network, see the picture above.
    n_filters : int, default 10
        Number of filters in each convolutional layers (except the last one).
    filter_length : int, default 5
        Length of used filters.

    Returns
    -------
    x : tensorflow placeholder
        Placeholder representing input sequences.
    y_hat : tensorflow placeholder
        Placeholder representing predicted output sequences.
    y : tensorflow placeholder
        Placeholder representing true output sequences. Use it for constructing
        a loss function.
    weights : list of tensorflow variables, length 2 * `n_levels` + 1
        List of convolution weights, the order is H, G, C.
    biases : list of tensorflow variables, length 2 * `n_levels` + 1
        List of convolution biases, the order is H, G, C.

    Notes
    -----
    Weights and biases will be initialized with truncated normal random
    variables with std of 0.1, you can reinitialize them using the returned
    `weights` and `biases` lists.
